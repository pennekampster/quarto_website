I have a background in global change ecology, and during my PhD with [Andreu Rico](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/college/en/profile-1285950309813.html?p2=anriar&idA=true), I have investigated the effects of multiple stressors on food web complexity and community stability. My PhD had a strong empirical focus, and I have performed multiple outdoor freshwater pond mesocosm experiments, as well as smaller, indoor, microcosm experiments to try to understand fundamental ecological processes. Particularly, I focused on how pulse disturbances can affect multiple dimensions of ecological stability (such as resistance, recovery, invariability, and resilience), and network complexity using weighted and unweighted metrics. 

In November 2022, I moved to the University of Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher, under the supervision of [Frank Pennekamp](https://frank-pennekamp.info) and [Owen Petchey](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/petchey_owen.html). My postdoc project focuses on understanding the role of response diversity in determining ecological stability in competitive and trophic communities under multiple environmental drivers. To address the topic, I will use series of theory-grounded microcosm experiments involving communities of ciliates.
