I come from a mixed background in Physics and Biology, and I’ve always been fascinated by where the two meet. During my Bachelor’s in Physics, I found myself drawn to the ways physical principles could help make sense of living systems. That curiosity shaped my path toward a Master’s in Physics of Life, where I specialized in Experimental Biophysics. For my Master’s thesis in Dr. Henrik Bringmann’s lab, I explored the link between sleep and metabolism in the roundworm _C. elegans_— a project that deepened my appreciation for how complex behaviors can emerge from simple biological systems.

For my doctoral project, I’m excited to bring together my experience in the wet lab with my physics background to study predator–prey dynamics. I’m particularly interested in how movement and behavior shape these interactions and what that can reveal about the underlying rules governing ecological systems.
