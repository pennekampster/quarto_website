During my Master's studies (supervised by Dr. [Romana Limberger](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/limberger_romana.html) and Dr. Frank Pennekamp), I investigated the effects of thermal evolution on a consumer-resource interaction using protist microcosms as model systems. 

In my PhD research, I use the same model systems to investigate the effects of multiple stressors on consumer-resource systems and their predictability.
