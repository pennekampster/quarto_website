My background is in conservation biology, but for my PhD with [Nicolas Schtickzelle](https://www.nicolas-schtickzelle.net/), I have shifted to microbial model systems to address fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. My PhD was focused on the genetic and environmental drivers of movement and dispersal of _Tetrahymena thermophila_ ciliates.

From 2014 to 2019, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with [Owen Petchey](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/petchey_owen.html) on understanding the effects of warming on community structure and composition, and the emerging field of ecological predictability.
