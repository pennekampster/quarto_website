This is the website of the predictive community ecology group led by [Frank Pennekamp](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/research/ecology/biotic_responses.html) in the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich.

In a nutshell, we are interested in how populations and communities respond to global change. To understand these responses, we work at the interface of experiments and theory: we work with microbial model systems and perform mathematical and statistical modeling.
