Understanding how microbial communities of aquatic ecosystems respond to environmental change remains a critical challenge in microbial ecology. In this study, we used light-dependent oxicâ€“anoxic micro-ecosystems to understand how the functioning and diversity of aerobic and anaerobic lake analog communities are affected by a pulse light deprivation. Continuous measurements of oxygen concentration were made and a time series of full-length 16S {rRNA} sequencing was used to quantify changes in alpha- and beta diversity. In the upper oxic layer, oxygen concentration decreased significantly under light reduction, but showed resilience in daily mean, minimum, and maximum after light conditions were restored to control level. Only the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations in oxygen concentrations did not recover fully, and instead tended to remain lower in treated ecosystems. Alpha diversity of the upper oxic layer communities showed a delayed increase after light conditions were restored, and was not resilient in the longer term. In contrast, alpha diversity of the anoxic lower layer communities increased during the light reduction, but was resilient in the longer term. Community composition changed significantly during light reduction, and showed resilience in the oxic layer and lack of resilience in the anoxic layer. Alpha diversity and the amplitude of daily oxygen fluctuations within and among treatments were strongly correlated, suggesting that higher diversity could lead to less variable oxygen concentrations, or vice versa. Our experiment showed that light deprivation induces multifaceted responses of community function (oxygen respiration) and structure, hence focusing on a single stability component could potentially be misleading.
