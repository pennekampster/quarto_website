Organismal abundance tends to decline with increasing body size. Metabolic theory links this size structure with energy use and productivity across levels of biological organization, predicting a size-abundance slope of -0.75 that is invariant across environments. We tested whether the size-abundance relationship is robust to a gradient of protist species richness (1 to 6 species), temperature (15 to 25° C), and time. Our results support the expected slope of -0.75 for the size-abundance relationship, but we found interactive effects indicating that the size-abundance relationship is not invariant. In high-richness communities, temperature increased the abundance of small protists more than that of the large protists, leading to a steeper size abundance slope. Temperature and size-dependent species interactions were identified as potential drivers. Understanding variation in size-abundance relationship hence provides novel insight into the underlying mechanisms shaping the size structure of ecological communities under environmental change.
