I am a PhD candidate supervised by [Shaopeng Li](https://liecology.com/people/) at East China Normal University. My main research interests are community ecology and invasion ecology. I use bacterial microcosm as model systems to figure out some fundamental questions of those two fields.

From January of 2023, I carry out research as an academic guest with [Frank Pennekamp](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/pennekamp_frank.html) at UZH to understand the effects of environmental variability on  biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and the field of ecological forecasting.
