    "section": "",
    "text": "Global biodiversity loss and climate change exacerbate feedbacks within social-ecological systems, i.e., between ecosystems, their services and well-being of human societies. Our ability to mediate these feedbacks is hampered by incomplete understanding of the underlying causal links, which could benefit from interdisciplinary approaches to discover theoretical or empirical links from heterogeneous data characteristic of social-ecological studies. We propose a novel framework connecting literature-based causal knowledge with data-driven inference of causality. We test this framework for the highly biodiverse island of Borneo by conducting a systematic literature review of 7473 studies over 170 years, and a causal inference analysis for three conceptual causal diagrams connecting global change, socio-economics, ecosystem services, and biodiversity-ecosystem function using a set of 227 spatially explicit variables. We find that, while natural or social processes have been mostly studied independently, a set of studies already documents causal links across social-ecological domains for processes related to deforestation, food or energy. Causal discovery unveiled consistent negative causal links between global change, social-economic landscape, and biodiversity-ecosystem function, and positive causal links between global change and socio-economics, and these links were robust to indicator selection and addition. We detected few and weak links between social-economic landscape, global change, and ecosystem services. When comparing the data-driven inferred causal links to those documented by the literature, we find that links between biodiversity and ecosystem function with global change, and links between social-economic landscape and ecosystem services were also consistent, and causal analysis uncovered new (potential) causal links not yet described in the literature."

    "title": "Predicting effects of multiple interacting global change drivers across trophic levels",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Global change encompasses many co-occurring anthropogenic drivers, which can act synergistically or antagonistically on ecological systems. Predicting how different global change drivers simultaneously contribute to observed biodiversity change is a key challenge for ecology and conservation. However, we lack the mechanistic understanding of how multiple global change drivers influence the vital rates of multiple interacting species. We propose that reaction norms, the relationships between a driver and vital rates like growth, mortality, and consumption, provide insights to the underlying mechanisms of community responses to multiple drivers. Understanding how multiple drivers interact to affect demographic rates using a reaction-norm perspective can improve our ability to make predictions of interactions at higher levels of organization—that is, community and food web. Building on the framework of consumer–resource interactions and widely studied thermal performance curves, we illustrate how joint driver impacts can be scaled up from the population to the community level. A simple proof-of-concept model demonstrates how reaction norms of vital rates predict the prevalence of driver interactions at the community level. A literature search suggests that our proposed approach is not yet used in multiple driver research. We outline how realistic response surfaces (i.e., multidimensional reaction norms) can be inferred by parametric and nonparametric approaches. Response surfaces have the potential to strengthen our understanding of how multiple drivers affect communities as well as improve our ability to predict when interactive effects emerge, two of the major challenges of ecology today."

    "text": "Agriculture is likely to expand poleward with climate change, encouraging deforestation for agriculture in subarctic regions, which alters soil physical, chemical and biological properties and potentially affects microbial metabolic efficiency. Deciphering how and by which mechanisms land-use change affects microbial carbon use efficiency ({CUE}) will enable the development of mitigation strategies to alleviate C losses. We assessed {CUE} using 18O-labelled water in a paired-plot approach on soils collected from 19 farms across the subarctic region of Yukon, Canada, comprising 14 pairs of forest-to-grassland conversion and 15 pairs of forest-to-cropland conversion. Microbial {CUE} significantly increased following conversion to grassland and cropland. Land-use conversion resulted in a lower estimated abundance of fungi, while the archaeal abundance increased. Interestingly, structural equation modelling revealed that increases in {CUE} were mediated by a rise in soil {pH} and a decrease in soil C:N ratio rather than by shifts in microbial community composition, i.e. the ratio of fungi, bacteria and archaea. Our findings indicate a direct control of abiotic factors on microbial {CUE} via improved nutrient availability and facilitated conditions for microbial growth. Overall, this implies that to a certain extent {CUE} can be managed to achieve a more efficient build-up of stabilised soil organic C ({SOC}), as reflected in increased mineral-associated organic C under agricultural land use. These insights may also help constrain {SOC} models that generally struggle to predict the effects of deforestation, something that is likely to take place more frequently in the subarctic."

    "text": "Trophic interaction modifications (TIM) are widespread in natural systems and occur when a third species indirectly alters the strength of a trophic interaction. Past studies have focused on documenting the existence and magnitude of TIMs; however, the underlying processes and long‐term consequences remain elusive. To address this gap, we experimentally quantified the density‐dependent effect of a third species on a predator’s functional response. We conducted short‐term experiments with ciliate communities composed of a predator, prey and non‐consumable ‘modifier’ species. In both communities, increasing modifier density weakened the trophic interaction strength, due to a negative effect on the predator’s space clearance rate. Simulated long‐term dynamics indicate quantitative differences between models that account for TIMs or include only pairwise interactions. Our study demonstrates that TIMs are important to understand and predict community dynamics and highlights the need to move beyond focal species pairs to understand the consequences of species interactions in communities."

    "text": "Dispersal is a central biological process tightly integrated into life-histories, morphology, physiology and behaviour. Such associations, or syndromes, are anticipated to impact the eco-evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations, and cascade into ecosystem processes. As for dispersal on its own, these syndromes are likely neither fixed nor random, but conditional on the experienced environment. We experimentally studied how dispersal propensity varies with individuals’ phenotype and local environmental harshness using 15 species ranging from protists to vertebrates. We reveal a general phenotypic dispersal syndrome across studied species, with dispersers being larger, more active and having a marked locomotion-oriented morphology and a strengthening of the link between dispersal and some phenotypic traits with environmental harshness. Our proof-of-concept metacommunity model further reveals cascading effects of context-dependent syndromes on the local and regional organisation of functional diversity. Our study opens new avenues to advance our understanding of the functioning of spatially structured populations, communities and ecosystems."

    "text": "Understanding how microbial communities of aquatic ecosystems respond to environmental change remains a critical challenge in microbial ecology. In this study, we used light-dependent oxic–anoxic micro-ecosystems to understand how the functioning and diversity of aerobic and anaerobic lake analog communities are affected by a pulse light deprivation. Continuous measurements of oxygen concentration were made and a time series of full-length 16S {rRNA} sequencing was used to quantify changes in alpha- and beta diversity. In the upper oxic layer, oxygen concentration decreased significantly under light reduction, but showed resilience in daily mean, minimum, and maximum after light conditions were restored to control level. Only the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations in oxygen concentrations did not recover fully, and instead tended to remain lower in treated ecosystems. Alpha diversity of the upper oxic layer communities showed a delayed increase after light conditions were restored, and was not resilient in the longer term. In contrast, alpha diversity of the anoxic lower layer communities increased during the light reduction, but was resilient in the longer term. Community composition changed significantly during light reduction, and showed resilience in the oxic layer and lack of resilience in the anoxic layer. Alpha diversity and the amplitude of daily oxygen fluctuations within and among treatments were strongly correlated, suggesting that higher diversity could lead to less variable oxygen concentrations, or vice versa. Our experiment showed that light deprivation induces multifaceted responses of community function (oxygen respiration) and structure, hence focusing on a single stability component could potentially be misleading."

Despite the TSR being widespread, the mechanisms for shrinking body size with warming remain elusive. Here, we experimentally test three hypotheses (differential development and growth [DDG], maintain aerobic scope and regulate oxygen supply [MASROS] and the supply-demand hypothesis [SD]) potentially explaining the TSR using the aquatic protist in three gradually changing and one constant temperature environment crossed with three different nutrient levels. We find that the constant and slowly warming environments show similar responses in terms of population dynamics, whereas populations with linear and fast warming quickly decline and show a stronger temperature-size response. Our analyses suggest that acclimation may have played a role in observing these differences among treatments. The SD hypothesis is most parsimonious with the data, however, neither the DDG nor the MASROS hypothesis can be firmly dismissed. We conclude that the TSR is driven by multiple ecological and acclimatory responses and hence multicausal."

    "text": "Phenotypic plasticity is increasingly recognized as a key element of eco-evolutionary dynamics, but it remains challenging to assess because of its multidimensional nature. Indeed, organisms live in complex environments where numerous factors can impact the phenotypic expression of traits (inter-environment axis), possess multiple traits that can influence each other’s expression (inter-trait axis) and differ in their genetic background (inter-genotype axis), which can not only impact the traits’ values but also their plasticity. We addressed six questions related to phenotypic plasticity: (a) do different environmental gradients show similar effects on a given trait? (b) Are the effects of two environmental gradients on a trait additive? (c) Do different traits show similar plastic response to a given environmental gradient? (d) Do the (co)variances between traits vary across environmental gradients? (e) Do genotypes differ in their plastic response to a given environmental gradient? (f) Are some genotypes more plastic than others across all traits? We designed a microcosm experiment using the protist Tetrahymena thermophila aimed at encompassing all these aspects of phenotypic plasticity. We exposed 15 distinct genotypes to 25 combinations of temperature and nutrient availability and assessed the plasticity of five phenotypic traits. Our results show strong differences in the plastic response depending on the environmental gradient, not only regarding the shape of the reaction norm of the different traits tested, but also in the overall plasticity of the organisms. We did not find any covariance between traits that was consistent across all environments. Overall, our results suggest independent impacts of the environmental dimension considered on the observed plastic response. These results underline potential difficulties in generalizing findings about plasticity to all environments and all traits.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The potential for climate change and temperature shifts to affect community stability remains relatively unknown. One mechanism by which temperature may affect stability is by altering trophic interactions. The functional response quantifies the per capita resource consumption by the consumer as a function of resource abundance and is a suitable framework for the description of nonlinear trophic interactions. We studied the effect of temperature on a ciliate predator–prey pair (Spathidium sp. and Dexiostoma campylum) by estimating warming effects on the functional response and on the associated conversion efficiency of the predator. We recorded prey and predator dynamics over 24 hr and at three temperature levels (15, 20 and 25°C). To these data, we fitted a population dynamic model including the predator functional response, such that the functional response parameters (space clearance rate, handling time and density dependence of space clearance rate) were estimated for each temperature separately. To evaluate the ecological significance of temperature effects on the functional response parameters, we simulated predator–prey population dynamics. We considered the predator–prey system to be destabilized, if the prey was driven extinct by the predator. Effects of increased temperature included a transition of the functional response from a Type III to a Type II and an increase of the conversion efficiency of the predator. The simulated population dynamics showed a destabilization of the system with warming, with greater risk of prey extinction at higher temperatures likely caused by the transition from a Type III to a Type II functional response. Warming-induced shifts from a Type III to II are not commonly considered in modelling studies that investigate how population dynamics respond to warming. Future studies should investigate the mechanism and generality of the effect we observed and simulate temperature effects in complex food webs including shifts in the type of the functional response as well as consider the possibility of a temperature-dependent conversion efficiency."

    "text": "Understanding how and why individual movement translates into dispersal between populations is a long-term goal in ecology. Movement is broadly defined as ‘any change in the spatial location of an individual’, whereas dispersal is more narrowly defined as a movement that may lead to gene flow. Because the former may create the condition for the latter, behavioural decisions that lead to dispersal may be detectable in underlying movement behaviour. In addition, dispersing individuals also have specific sets of morphological and behavioural traits that help them coping with the costs of movement and dispersal, and traits that mitigate costs should be under selection and evolve if they have a genetic basis. Here, we experimentally study the relationships between movement behaviour, morphology and dispersal across 44 genotypes of the actively dispersing unicellular, aquatic model organism Tetrahymena thermophila. We used two-patch populations to quantify individual movement trajectories, as well as activity, morphology and dispersal rate. First, we studied variation in movement behaviour among and within genotypes (i.e. between dispersers and residents) and tested whether this variation can be explained by morphology. Then, we addressed how much the dispersal rate is driven by differences in the underlying movement behaviour. Genotypes revealed clear differences in terms of movement speed and linearity. We also detected marked movement differences between resident and dispersing individuals, mediated by the genotype. Movement variation was partly explained by morphological properties such as cell size and shape, with larger cells consistently showing higher movement speed and higher linearity. Genetic differences in activity and movement were positively related to the observed dispersal and jointly explained 47\\% of the variation in dispersal rate. Our study shows that a detailed understanding of the interplay between morphology, movement and dispersal may have potential to improve dispersal predictions over broader spatio-temporal scales."

To adapt to what the future holds and to manage the impacts of global change, scientists need to predict the expected effects with some confidence and communicate these predictions to policy makers. However, recent reviews found that we currently lack a clear understanding of how predictable ecology is, with views seeing it as mostly unpredictable to potentially predictable, at least over short time frames. However, in applied, ecology-related fields predictions are more commonly formulated and reported, as well as evaluated in hindsight, potentially allowing one to define baselines of predictive proficiency in these fields. We searched the literature for representative case studies in these fields and collected information about modeling approaches, target variables of prediction, predictive proficiency achieved, as well as the availability of data to parameterize predictive models. We find that some fields such as epidemiology achieve high predictive proficiency, but even in the more predictive fields proficiency is evaluated in different ways. Both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are used in most fields, but differences are often small, with no clear superiority of one approach over the other. Data availability is limiting in most fields, with long-term studies being rare and detailed data for parameterizing mechanistic models being in short supply. We suggest that ecologists adopt a more rigorous approach to report and assess predictive proficiency, and embrace the challenges of real world decision making to strengthen the practice of prediction in ecology."

    "text": "The development of video-based monitoring methods allows for rapid, dynamic and accurate monitoring of individuals or communities, compared to slower traditional methods, with far reaching ecological and evolutionary applications. Large amounts of data are generated using video-based methods, which can be effectively processed using machine learning (ML) algorithms into meaningful ecological information. ML uses user defined classes (e.g. species), derived from a subset (i.e. training data) of video-observed quantitative features (e.g. phenotypic variation), to infer classes in subsequent observations. However, phenotypic variation often changes due to environmental conditions, which may lead to poor classification, if environmentally induced variation in phenotypes is not accounted for. Here we describe a framework for classifying species under changing environmental conditions based on the random forest classification. A sliding window approach was developed that restricts temporal and environmentally conditions to improve the classification. We tested our approach by applying the classification framework to experimental data. The experiment used a set of six ciliate species to monitor changes in community structure and behavior over hundreds of generations, in dozens of species combinations and across a temperature gradient. Differences in biotic and abiotic conditions caused simplistic classification approaches to be unsuccessful. In contrast, the sliding window approach allowed classification to be highly successful, as phenotypic differences driven by environmental change, could be captured by the classifier. Importantly, classification using the random forest algorithm showed comparable success when validated against traditional, slower, manual identification. Our framework allows for reliable classification in dynamic environments, and may help to improve strategies for long-term monitoring of species in changing environments. Our classification pipeline can be applied in fields assessing species community dynamics, such as eco-toxicology, ecology and evolutionary ecology."

However, extracting information from raw movement data requires advanced analysis techniques, for instance to infer behaviors expressed during a certain period of the recorded trajectory, or gender or species identity in case data is obtained from remote tracking. In this paper, we address how different movement features affect the ability to automatically classify the species identity, using a dataset of unicellular microbes (i.e., ciliates). Previously, morphological attributes and simple movement metrics, such as speed, were used for classifying ciliate species. Here, we demonstrate that adding advanced movement features, in particular such based on discrete wavelet transform, to morphological features can improve classification. These results may have practical applications in automated monitoring of waste water facilities as well as environmental monitoring of aquatic systems."

From the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging, because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance, morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning to automatically classify individuals into species and that information on movement behavior improves the predictive ability."

However, alarming negative trends have been reported for butterfly populations in that region emphasizing the urgent need to better understand the drivers of their population declines. Habitat specialists of grasslands are strongly affected, mainly by land use change and climate change. Thorough assessments of habitat requirements and dispersal abilities are crucial to establish appropriate conservation measures to counter these threats. Here, we investigate the ecological requirements and dispersal ability of Euphydryas desfontainii, one of Portugal’s rarest butterflies, to develop targeted conservation strategies. The assessment of habitat requirements showed differences between occupied and unoccupied patches in terms of host plant abundance and area. Mark–release–recapture data were used to model demographic parameters: survival rates decreased linearly over the flight period and recruitment followed a parabolic curve with separate peaks for males and females. The movement data were fitted to an inverse power function and used to predict the probability of long-distance dispersal. The obtained probabilities were compared to related checkerspot butterflies and interpreted regarding the structural connectivity of the investigated habitat network. We suggest focusing on the preservation of remaining habitat patches, whilst monitoring and safeguarding that their vegetation structure does provide sufficiently diversified microclimates in order to best conserve E. desfontainii populations."

More recently, habitat quality has been highlighted as being equally important. We therefore assess the role of habitat area, isolation and quality for the occupancy of larval stages of the regionally threatened butterfly Euphydryas desfontainii occurring in grassland habitats comprising the host plant Dipsascus comosus. We put a special focus on habitat quality which was determined on two spatial scales: the landscape (among patches) and the within-patch level. On the landscape level, occupancy of caterpillars was determined by a presence-absence analysis at 28 host plant patches. On the within-patch level, oviposition site selection was studied by comparing 159 host plants with egg clutches to a random sample of 253 unoccupied host plants within six habitat patches. The occupancy of caterpillars and presence of egg clutches on host plants was then related to several predictors such as patch size and isolation on the landscape level and host plant characteristics and immediate surroundings on the within patch level. On the landscape level, only host plant abundance was related to the presence of caterpillars, while size and isolation did not differ between occupied and unoccupied patches. However, the weak discrimination of larval stages among patches changed on the within-patch level: here, several microclimatic predictors such as sunshine hours and topography, host plant morphology and phenology as well as further potential host plants in the immediate surroundings of the plant chosen for oviposition strongly determined the presence of egg clutches. We strongly suggest promoting the presence of the host plant in topographically and structurally rich habitat patches to offer potential for microclimatic compensation for a species considered threatened by climate change."

    "text": "Next position\nSNF mobility fellowship at the University of Montpellier, France\n\n\nResearch Interests\nI am an experimental evolutionary ecologist interested in understanding how environmental context (e.g., food web structure, resource quality) modifies species interactions. Species interactions are among the most important forces structuring ecological communities and are often environment-dependent. Current approaches to predict changes in community structure over time often fail to reproduce observed dynamics, suggesting that ecologists are missing important biological mechanisms causing the patterns we see in nature. My research aims to quantify the ecological and evolutionary impact of environmental context on species interactions to better understand the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity and drive community dynamics.\n\n\nEducation"

My PhD had a strong empirical focus, and I have performed multiple outdoor freshwater pond mesocosm experiments, as well as smaller, indoor, microcosm experiments to try to understand fundamental ecological processes. Particularly, I focused on how pulse disturbances can affect multiple dimensions of ecological stability (such as resistance, recovery, invariability, and resilience), and network complexity using weighted and unweighted metrics.\nIn November 2022, I moved to the University of Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher, under the supervision of Frank Pennekamp and Owen Petchey.

Combining ELS with automated image analysis could significantly boost information acquisition due to the ease at which abundance and morphological data is collected. Despite the advantages of image analysis, the technology has not been fully adopted yet, presumably due to the difficulties of technical implementation.\nThe tools needed to integrate image analysis in ELS are nowadays readily available: digital camera equipment is purchased at limited costs and free software solutions which allow sophisticated image processing and analysis exist. Here, we give a concise description how to integrate these pieces into a largely automated image analysis workflow. We provide researchers with necessary background information on the principles of image analysis, explaining how to standardize image acquisition and how to validate the results to reduce bias. Three cross-platform and open-source software solutions for image analysis are compared: ImageJ, the EBImage package in R, and Python with the SciPy/scikit image libraries. The relative strengths and limitations of each solution are compared and discussed. In addition, a set of test images and three scripts are provided in the Online Supplementary Material to illustrate the use of image analysis and help biologists to implement image analysis in their own systems. To demonstrate the reliability and versatility of a validated image analysis workflow, we introduce our own Tetrahymena thermophila ELS. Then, examples from evolutionary ecology are provided showing the advantages of image analysis to study different ecological questions, aiming at both the population and individual level. Experimental laboratory systems that integrate the advantages of image analysis extend their application and versatility compared with regular ELS. Such improvements are necessary to understand complex processes such as eco-evolutionary feedbacks, community dynamics and individual behaviour in ELS.”"

Understanding how genotypes (G), environments (E), and their interaction (genotype and environment; G × E) each affects dispersal propensity is therefore instrumental for predicting the ecological and evolutionary responses of species under global change. Here we used an actively dispersing ciliate to quantify the contributions of G, E, and G × E on dispersal propensity, exposing 44 different genotypes to three different environmental contexts (densities in isogenotype populations). Moreover, we assessed the condition dependence of dispersal, that is, whether dispersal is related to morphological, physiological, or behavioral traits. We found that genotypes showed marked differences in dispersal propensity and that dispersal is plastically adjusted to density, with the overall trend for genotypes to exhibit negative density-dependent dispersal. A small, but significant G × E interaction indicates genetic variability in plasticity and therefore some potential for dispersal plasticity to evolve. We also show evidence consistent with condition-dependent dispersal suggesting that genotypes also vary in how individual condition is linked to dispersal under different environmental contexts thereby generating complex dispersal behavior due to only three variables (genes, environment, and individual condition)."

In this thesis, I used controlled microcosms of a unicellular organism, the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, to experimentally investigate various aspects of dispersal ecology. Firstly, I describe how digital image and video analysis can be used to rapidly and reliably quantify traits and abundances of the model organism. Secondly, I investigated the relative roles of the genotype and the environment on dispersal in a two-patch system by comparing how 44 genetically different lines dispersed in response to conspecific density. We found genetic variation for dispersal plasticity and hence potential for dispersal plasticity to evolve. Thirdly, I report how an individual-based simulation model parameterized with characteristics of video-recorded cell trajectories accounted for 45\\% of the variation in dispersal observed among genotypes. Finally, I describe the dispersal syndromes (co-variation of dispersal with other traits) found in this set of genotypes, which bear important information about the costs and evolution of dispersal: (1) negative co-variation of dispersal-related traits with peak cell density and cell survival; (2) the absence of a link between short- and long-distance dispersal. The results in this thesis contribute to our understanding of condition-dependent dispersal, dispersal syndromes, links with the general movement ecology and introduce several methodological advances widely applicable in experimental laboratory systems."

Also, a variety of manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying connectivity in spatial microcosm networks.* Past studies, however, have used varying methods for maintenance, measurement, and manipulation, which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow cytometry, image and video analyses, and in situ environmental probes provide novel and improved opportunities to quantify variables of interest at unprecedented precision and temporal resolution.* Here, we take the first step towards a standardization of well-established and novel methods and techniques within the field of protist microcosm experiments. We provide a comprehensive overview of maintenance, measurement and manipulation methods. An extensive supplement contains detailed protocols of all methods, and these protocols also exist in a community updateable online repository.* We envision that such a synthesis and standardization of methods will overcome shortcomings and challenges faced by past studies and also promote activities such as meta-analyses and distributed experiments conducted simultaneously across many different laboratories at a global scale.”"

The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons.

Modern tracking techniques produce high-frequency observations of spatial positions of animals and accompanying speed and tortuosity measurements. However, inferring behavioural modes from movement trajectories remains a challenge.* Changes in behavioural modes occur at different temporal and spatial scales and may take two forms: abrupt, representing distinct change points; or continuous, representing smooth transitions between movement modes. The multi-scale nature of these behavioural changes necessitates development of methods that can pinpoint behavioural states across spatial and temporal scales.* We propose a novel segmentation method based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), where the movement signal is decomposed into low-frequency approximation and high-frequency detail sub-bands to screen for behavioural changes at multiple scales. Approximation sub-bands characterizes broad changes by taking the continuous variations between behavioural modes into account, whereas detail sub-bands are employed to detect abrupt, finer scale change points.* We tested the ability of our method to identify behavioural modes in simulated trajectories by comparing it to three state-of-the-art methods from the literature. We further validated the method using an annotated dataset of turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) relating extracted segments to the expert knowledge of migratory vs. non-migratory patterns. Our results show that the proposed DWT segmentation is more versatile than other segmentation methods, as it can be applied to different movement parameters, performs better or equally well on the simulated data, and correctly identifies behavioural modes identified by the experts. It is hence a valuable addition to the toolbox of land managers and conservation practitioners to understand the behavioural patterns expressed by animals in natural and human-dominated landscapes."

Whereas effects of individual environmental changes (e.g. temperature change or change in resource availability) are reasonably well understood, we lack information about if and how multiple changes interact. We examined interactions among four types of environmental disturbance (temperature, nutrient ratio, carbon enrichment, and light) in a fully factorial design using a microbial aquatic ecosystem and observed responses of dissolved oxygen saturation at three temporal scales (resistance, resilience, and return time). We tested whether multiple disturbances combine in a dominant, additive, or interactive fashion, and compared the predictability of dissolved oxygen across scales. Carbon enrichment and shading reduced oxygen concentration in the short term (i.e. resistance); although no other effects or interactions were statistically significant, resistance decreased as the number of disturbances increased. In the medium term, only enrichment accelerated recovery, but none of the other effects (including interactions) were significant. In the long term, enrichment and shading lengthened return times, and we found significant two-way synergistic interactions between disturbances. The best performing model (dominant, additive, or interactive) depended on the temporal scale of response. In the short term (i.e. for resistance), the dominance model predicted resistance of dissolved oxygen best, due to a large effect of carbon enrichment, whereas none of the models could predict the medium term (i.e. resilience). The long-term response was best predicted by models including interactions among disturbances. Our results indicate the importance of accounting for the temporal scale of responses when researching the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystems."

Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information."

    "text": "Intraspecific trait change, including altered behaviour or morphology, can drive temporal variation in interspecific interactions and population dynamics. In turn, variation in species’ interactions and densities can alter the strength and direction of trait change. The resulting feedback between species’ traits and abundance permits a wide range of community dynamics that would not be expected from ecological theories purely based on species abundances. Despite the theoretical importance of these interrelated processes, unambiguous experimental evidence of how intraspecific trait variation modifies species interactions and population dynamics and how this feeds back to influence trait variation is currently required. We investigate the role of trait-mediated demography in determining community dynamics and examine how ecological interactions influence trait change. We concurrently monitored the dynamics of community abundances and individual traits in an experimental microbial predator–prey–resource system. Using this data, we parameterised a trait-dependent community model to identify key ecologically relevant traits and to link trait dynamics with those of species abundances. Our results provide clear evidence of a feedback between trait change, demographic rates and species dynamics. The inclusion of trait–abundance feedbacks into our population model improved the predictability of ecological dynamics from r2 of 34% to 57% and confirmed theoretical expectations of density-dependent population growth and species interactions in the system. Additionally, our model revealed that the feedbacks were underpinned by a trade-off between population growth and anti-predatory defence. High predator abundance was linked to a reduction in prey body size. This prey size decrease was associated with a reduction in its rate of consumption by predators and a decrease in its resource consumption. Modelling trait–abundance feedbacks allowed us to pinpoint the underlying life history trade-off which links trait and abundance dynamics. These results show that accounting for trait–abundance feedbacks has the potential to improve understanding and predictability of ecological dynamics.A plain language summaryis available for this article."

Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems’ intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE–FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system’s intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated."

We collected data from aquatic microbial ecosystems investigating the interactive effects of warming (constant and rising temperatures) and enrichment across levels of organisation and contrasted them with community models based on metabolic theory. We found high agreement between our observations and theoretical predictions: we observed in many cases the predicted antagonistic effects of high temperature and high enrichment across levels of organisation. Temporal stability of total biomass decreased with warming but did not differ across enrichment levels. Constant and rising temperature treatments with identical mean temperature did not show qualitative differences. Overall, we conclude that model and empirical results are in broad agreement due to robustness of the effects of temperature and enrichment, that the mitigating effects of temperature on effects of enrichment may be common, and that models based on metabolic theory provide qualitatively robust predictions of the combined ecological effects of enrichment and temperature."

Here, we show how comparing effects of temperature on species grown in isolation and when grown together helps our understanding of how ecological communities more generally respond to environmental change. In particular, we find that the shape of the feasibility domain (the parameter space of carrying capacities compatible with positive species’ abundances) helps to explain the composition of experimental microbial communities under changing environmental conditions. First, we introduce a measure to quantify the asymmetry of a community’s feasibility domain using the column vectors of the corresponding interaction matrix. These column vectors describe the effects each species has on all other species in the community (hereafter referred to as species’ multidimensional effects). We show that as the asymmetry of the feasibility domain increases the relationship between species’ abundance when grown together and when grown in isolation weakens. We then show that microbial communities experiencing different temperature environments exhibit patterns consistent with this theory. Specifically, communities at warmer temperatures show relatively more asymmetry; thus, the idiosyncrasy of responses is higher compared with that in communities at cooler temperatures. These results suggest that while species’ interactions are typically defined at the pairwise level, multispecies dynamics can be better understood by focusing on the effects of these interactions at the community level."

This is concerning because it could lead to significant underestimations or overestimations of threats to biodiversity. Furthermore, stressors have been largely classified by their source rather than by the mechanisms and ecological scales at which they act (the target). Here, we argue, first, that a more nuanced classification of stressors by target and ecological scale can generate valuable new insights and hypotheses about stressor interactions. Second, that the predictability of multiple stressor effects, and consistent patterns in their impacts, can be evaluated by examining the distribution of stressor effects across targets and ecological scales.

Yet, they are decreasing globally at a higher rate than other mangrove ecosystems. In addition to human drivers, local environmental factors influence the functioning of lagoonal mangrove ecosystems, but their importance and combined effects are relatively unknown. Here, we investigate the drivers of mangrove functioning, approximated by mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB), in a protected lagoonal mangrove ecosystem on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Based on a survey of the mangrove forest structure in 54 plots, we estimated that the mean mangrove forest AGB was 82 ±13 Mg ha−1. The total AGB of the mangrove area (1720 ha) was nearly 140,600 Mg, equivalent to about 66,100 Mg of carbon stored in the standing biomass on Aldabra. To assess the direct and indirect effects of soil nutrient content, water level variation and soil salinity on mangrove AGB, we used a structural equation model. Our structural equation model explained 82% of the variation in mangrove AGB. The soil nutrient content (concentration of essential macronutrients in the soil column) had the greatest influence on mangrove AGB variation. Additionally, high variation in water level (change in water depth covering a location) increased mangrove AGB by increasing nutrient content levels. Our results highlight the important contribution of Aldabra’s lagoonal ecosystem to Seychelles’ carbon storage and the role of hydroperiod as a regulator controlling the availability of crucial nutrients needed for the functioning of mangroves within lagoonal systems. We suggest conservation managers worldwide focus on a holistic ecosystem-level perspective for successful mangrove conservation, including the protection and maintenance of nutrient cycling and hydrological processes."

To investigate forecast skill within and across systems, we monitored a microbial system exposed to either constant or fluctuating temperatures in a 5-month-long laboratory experiment. We tested how forecasting of species abundances depends on the number and strength of interactions and on model size (number of predictors). We also tested how greater system complexity (i.e. the fluctuating temperatures) impacted these relations. We found that the more interactions a species had, the weaker these interactions were and the better its abundance was predicted. Forecast skill increased with model size. Greater system complexity decreased forecast skill for three out of eight species. These insights into how abundance prediction depends on the connectedness of the species within the system and on overall system complexity could improve species forecasting and monitoring."

The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) posits scaling of biological rates with temperature, but it has had limited application to population dynamic forecasting. Here we use the temperature dependence of the MTE to constrain empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), an equation-free nonlinear machine learning approach for forecasting. By rescaling time with temperature and modeling dynamics on a “metabolic time step,” our method (MTE-EDM) improved forecast accuracy in 18 of 19 empirical ectotherm time series (by 19% on average), with the largest gains in more seasonal environments. MTE-EDM assumes that temperature affects only the rate, rather than the form, of population dynamics, and that interacting species have approximately similar temperature dependence. A review of laboratory studies suggests these assumptions are reasonable, at least approximately, though not for all ecological systems. Our approach highlights how to combine modern data-driven forecasting techniques with ecological theory and mechanistic understanding to predict the response of complex ecosystems to temperature variability and trends."

However, existing measures of response diversity only consider a single environmental variable, whereas natural communities are commonly exposed to changes in multiple environmental variables simultaneously. Thus far, no approach exists to integrate multifarious environmental change and the measurement of response diversity. Here, we show how to consider and quantify response diversity in the context of multifarious environmental change, and in doing so introduce a distinction between response diversity to a defined or anticipated environmental change, and the response capacity to any possible set of (defined or undefined) future environmental changes. First, we describe and illustrate the concepts with empirical data. We reveal the role of the trajectory of environmental change in shaping response diversity when multiple environmental variables fluctuate over time. We show that, when the trajectory of the environmental change is undefined (i.e., there is no information or a priori expectation about how an environmental condition will change in future), we can quantify the response capacity of a community to any possible environmental change scenario. That is, we can estimate the capacity of a system to respond under a range of realistic or extreme environmental changes, with utility for predicting future responses to even multifarious environmental change. Finally, we investigate determinants of response diversity within a multifarious environmental change context. We identify factors such as the diversity of species responses to each environmental variable, the relative influence of different environmental variables and temporal means of environmental variable values as important determinants of response diversity. In doing so, we take an important step towards measuring and understanding the insurance capacity of ecological communities exposed to multifarious environmental change."

    "text": "Community ecology is built on theories that represent the strength of interactions between species as pairwise links. Higher-order interactions (HOIs) occur when a species changes the pairwise interaction between a focal pair. Recent theoretical work has highlighted the stabilizing role of HOIs for large, simulated communities, yet it remains unclear how important higher-order effects are in real communities. Here, we used experimental communities of aquatic protists to examine the relationship between HOIs and stability (as measured by the persistence of a species in a community). We cultured a focal pair of consumers in the presence of additional competitors and a predator and collected time series data of their abundances. We then fitted competition models with and without HOIs to measure interaction strength between the focal pair across different community compositions. We used survival analysis to measure the persistence of individual species. We found evidence that additional species positively affected persistence of the focal species and that HOIs were present in most of our communities. However, persistence was only linked to HOIs for one of the focal species. Our results vindicate community ecology theory positing that species interactions may deviate from assumptions of pairwise interactions, opening avenues to consider possible consequences for coexistence and stability."

    "title": "Biodiversity increases the forecastability of species abundances in changing environments",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Accurate forecasts of ecological dynamics are critical for ecosystem management and conservation, yet the drivers of forecastability are poorly understood. Here we show that experiments are a powerful (but underutilized) tool to explore the limits of ecological forecasting. We conducted a long-term microcosm experiment with aquatic protists and manipulated two potential drivers of forecastability: biodiversity and environmental change (light). We applied data-driven forecasting methods to finely-resolved time series of species abundances and ecosystem properties. The experimental treatments had interactive effects on abundance forecasts. Specifically, biodiversity increased forecastability in changing environments but reduced forecastability in constant environments. However, forecasts of ecosystem properties were only weakly affected by the experimental treatments. Our results indicate that the combination of biodiversity loss and environmental change could make populations particularly unpredictable. The implications for ecological conservation are worrying: diversity loss might impair decision-taking by reducing the forecastability of ecological dynamics in changing environments."
