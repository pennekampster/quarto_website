We are interested in the effects of environmental change on the stability of ecological communities. We use a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches to understand how multiple facets of stability are affected by temperature change. A particular focus of our work is to understand how the effects of environmental change on stability are mediated by the interactions between species.
